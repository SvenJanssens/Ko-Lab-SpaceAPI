# Ko-Lab-SpaceAPI

This is the Git repository for the Ko-Lab-SpaceAPI Discord bot hosted at https://replit.com/@SvenJanssens/Ko-Lab-SpaceAPI.

Most of the files on GitHub are generated by Replit.

The main files for consideration are the following:
* main.py - Contains the actual logic of the bot. It checks the content of the SpaceAPI JSON located at https://vloer.ko-lab.space/spaceapi.json (configured in config.toml) and based on the content of the state/open field the bot will:
  * post status update messages in a specified channel (configured in an environment variable BOT_CHANNEL);
  * update its status to "Watching an open space" or "Watching a closed space";
  * reply with the current status after a user enters ?space-open in a text channel to which the bot has access.
* keep_alive.py - Contains a basic web server, this is used because hosted bots will get shut down after an hour on Replit. This is avoided by using this web server and polling it from a service like https://www.uptimerobot.com/
* config.toml - Configuration file currently having settings for:
  * The URL which will return the SpaceAPI JSON
  * The messages used by the bot to reply to ?space-open
  * The statuses used by the bot to set its own status
